When conducting research at CSU, it is important to protect yourself, as well as other individuals and animals that may be used for a research study. This section focuses on the ethics of animal welfare as a component of responsible conduct of research. Since most institutions mandate training for those working with animals, this section will introduce you to the institutional and investigator responsibilities when working with animals, as well as the resources and committees available to you at CSU in order to ensure compliance and safety with your research.

## Then vs. Now

There are several examples of animal research abuse prior to federal regulation being implemented. Some of the most famous examples include:

**[Silver Spring Monkeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spring_monkeys)** : This experiment demonstrated a fundamentally important scientific principle regarding the ability of adult brains to rewire (neuroplasticity), but the cruelty of the experiments themselves outraged most citizens.

Stan Wayman's photo essay on " **[Concentration Camp for Lost and Stolen Dogs](http://www.vintag.es/2014/11/concentration-camps-for-dogs-1966.html)** ". Images of starving and neglected dogs of the "animal dealer", Lester Brown, propelled Congressional action to approve the Animal Welfare Act, which continues to provide protection of animals used in research and teaching.

> The most critical factor leading to social disenchantment with science has been the singular failure of the scientific community to engage the myriad ethical issues emerging from scientific activity. This is particularly problematic in an age that is suffused with ethical concern, a situation that paradigmatically characterizes the United States during the last half-century.

## CSU's IACUC

The conduct of ethical research is a long-standing tradition at Colorado State University (CSU). Part of this tradition is a continuing dedication to the humane and ethical care of animals used in research and teaching. This dedication, as well as federal regulations pertaining to the use of animals in research and teaching, requires Colorado State University to maintain a supervisory committee for the use of animals in research. This committee is known as the [Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee](https://vpr.research.colostate.edu/RICRO/iacuc/about-the-iacuc) or [IACUC](https://vpr.research.colostate.edu/RICRO/iacuc/) . The IACUC reviews and regulates the use of animals for both research and teaching.

> A moment's reflection on the development of large-scaled animal research and high-technology agriculture will elucidate why these innovations have led to the advent of a demand for a new ethic for animals in society. In a nutshell, these innovations represent a radically different playing field for animal use from what has characterized most of human history, and one wherein the traditional ethic grows increasingly relevant. ... People realize that biomedical and other scientific research, toxicological safety testing, uses of animals in teaching, pharmaceutical product extraction from animals, and so on, all produce far more suffering than does overt cruelty.

## Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees

#### Composition

Federal agencies require IACUCs, which must include a minimum of five members, and must include individuals meeting the criteria below. This helps to provide a diversity of perspectives, and avoid conflict of interest.

- **Veterinarian** with program responsibilities
- **Scientist** experienced in laboratory animal procedures
- **Non-scientist**
- **Non-affiliate**, someone with no affiliation with the institution other than sitting on the IACUC committee.

At CSU, we also have representatives from each college that uses animals, as well as a University Bioethicist.

#### Responsibilities

- **Review and approve**, require modifications to, or withhold approval to animal care and use protocols.
- **Review and investigate** legitimate concerns involving the care and use of laboratory animals resulting from public, employee or student complaints.
- **Suspend** an activity involving animals if non-compliance is verified; take corrective action and report non-compliance to funding agencies.
- **Inspect** all of the animal facilities, including animal study areas and satellite facilities at least once every six months.

## When do you need to engage the IACUC about your activities?

- Before you do research or testing with animals
- Before you use animals to teach or demonstrate anything
- Before you conduct exhibits with animals
- When you have concerns about the welfare of animals used in any of the above

You will need IACUC approval of a "**protocol**." In addition:

- Graduate students may not be the PI on a protocol
- All personnel must demonstrate their training qualifications prior to being named on a protocol

## Animal Protocols

- Must be submitted online at [https://csu.keyusa.net/](https://csu.keyusa.net/)
- Are reviewed once a month by the IACUC; protocols that involve procedures causing no more than momentary pain or distress are reviewed on an ongoing basis
- Annual continuing review is required
- Are peer reviewed to reduce, refine, and replace animal use and make judgments on key concepts such as "pain" and "distress" that the animal will obtain
- Address issues that, when they go wrong, could be viewed by others as having contributed to "animal abuse"

#### The Three Rs

In 1959, two British scientists, William Russell and Rex Burch, described three important concepts (now known widely as the "Three R's") with the goal of minimizing animal use and pain or distress while achieving scientific objectives.

#### Replacement

Replacement of animals by other systems

*Methods*: Computer modeling or in vitro testing may be a substitute for animal models. "Lower" or non-vertebrate animals, such as the fruit fly may be used in some situations rather than a higher order animal.

#### Reduction

Reduction of the number of animals used for research

*Methods*: Statistical analysis can maximize statistical power while minimizing the number of animals used. Pilot studies may help determine optimal group size. In some cases, use of more animals may humanely reduce the number of procedures on each animal.

#### Refinement

Refinement of study design to decrease the amount of pain and distress experienced by animals

*Methods*: Anesthetics and analgesics are used to relieve pain wherever possible. The use of early endpoints โ or euthanizing animals at early indicators of disease, before they experience further suffering - can also be a form of refinement.

#### Pain and Distress

The USDA requires an annual report on the number of animals (by species) in which:

- Procedures caused no pain or distress;
- Pain or distress during procedures was appropriately relieved using pain- or distress-relieving drugs;
- Procedures caused pain or distress that was not relieved for scientific reasons.

Thus, the IACUC generally asks an investigator to categorize the animals they request in their protocol by using the same USDA system.

> Common sense would dictate that one of the worst things one can do to a research animal is to cause unrelieved pain. As animals do not understand sources of painโparticularly the sort of pain inflicted in experimentsโthey cannot rationalize that it will end soon, and their whole life becomes the pain. This insight has led veterinary pain specialists ... to surmise that animal pain might be even worse than human pain; after all, humans have hope. Furthermore, pain is a source of stress, and can skew the results of experiments in numerous ways. Therefore, for both moral and scientific reasons, one would expect a crucial emphasis on pain control in painful experiments.

## Case Study: Animal Safety

Your colleague, Dr. Jay Mahata, is an NIH supported investigator who has an established collaboration with a field biologist, Dr. Ellen Yu, in another state. Dr. Yu does not receive any grant support for her research. Dr. Mahata sometimes receives blood and other tissue samples for analysis from the wild rodents that Dr. Yu traps for her research; her only reason for collecting the blood is to provide it to Dr. Mahata. Dr. Mahata has asked you to read his latest IACUC protocol prior to its formal submission. You note that the collaboration is not mentioned in the protocol. When you ask Dr. Mahata about this he says that he "does not have to report this activity to the IACUC because there are not any animal welfare concerns involved". He points out to you that he does not sacrifice the rodents or collect the blood and tissues. He maintains that the relevant animal welfare concerns are between Dr. Yu and her institution. Lastly, he suggests that because the NIH does not support her work, it does not have to conform to the same guidelines to which his own work is subject.
